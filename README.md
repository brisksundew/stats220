# stats220
## Hello, this is my repository for the STATS220 course I am currently taking at the University Of Auckland.
This is my *first time* using **Github**, which is a requirement for part of our first project.

I find this project very informative and usefu as I am discovering how interesting Github is, which is never a thought that has crossed my mind before.

This semester I feel very
1. Stressed
2. Tired
   - Depressed from stress and tiredness

I cope through semesters by listening to sad and *dramatic* music, like Lana Del Rey.

My favourites songs of hers include:
- Ride
- National Anthem
- Florida Kilos

I am still getting the hang of Github, but it seems very interesting so far, I am currently having fun adding emojis to my repo :disappointed_relieved: :sweat_smile: :poop: :cookie: :poultry_leg:

This is a link I frequent a lot, and I assume every other student too!
